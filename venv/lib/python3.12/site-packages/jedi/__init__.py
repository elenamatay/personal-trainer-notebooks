"""
Jedi is a static analysis tool for Python that is typically used in
IDEs/editors plugins. Jedi has a focus on autocompletion and goto
functionality. Other features include refactoring, code search and finding
references.

Jedi has a simple API to work with. There is a reference implementation as a
`VIM-Plugin <https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim>`_. Autocompletion in your
REPL is also possible, IPython uses it natively and for the CPython REPL you
can install it. Jedi is well tested and bugs should be rare.

Here's a simple example of the autocompletion feature:

>>> import jedi
>>> source = '''
... import json
... json.lo'''
>>> script = jedi.Script(source, path='example.py')
>>> script
<Script: 'example.py' ...>
>>> completions = script.complete(3, len('json.lo'))
>>> completions
[<Completion: load>, <Completion: loads>]
>>> print(completions[0].complete)
ad
>>> print(completions[0].name)
load
