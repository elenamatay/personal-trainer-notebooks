        "commentary": "The \npush-up\n is a classic bodyweight exercise for the upper body, with the benefit that you don\u2019t need any equipment to perform it. In push-ups, you lift about 70% of your own body weight, but you can increase or decrease that amount by placing your feet or hands, respectively, on an elevation. This version of the push-up increases the load since your feet are elevated to a sofa, chair, bench, weight plates, or whatever you are using.\nYou can also vary the exercise by placing your hands closer och wider apart, which will transfer more of the load to the triceps or chest, respectively.\nA hidden bonus with push-ups is that you also get some static training of your core, similar to that of the plank exercise. To get even more core training, you can do your push-ups with either your hands or feet in a pair of suspended gymnastic rings or similar."

In push-ups, you lift about 70% of your own body weight, but you can increase or decrease that amount by placing your feet or hands, respectively, on an elevation. This version of the push-up decreases the load since your hands are elevated to the sofa, chair, bench or whatever you are using. \nYou can also vary the exercise by placing your hands closer och wider apart, which will transfer more of the load to the triceps or chest, respectively.\nA hidden bonus with push-ups is that you also get some static training of your core, similar to that of the plank exercise. To get even more core training, you can do your push-ups with either your hands or feet in a pair of suspended gymnastic rings or similar."

The dumbbells increase the demand for shoulder stability, and can also enable a longer range of motion. With dumbbells, you might also be able to move your arms more to your sides compared to a barbell, which can emphasize the training effect of the medial deltoids.\nThis exercise can be done both standing and sitting, with one or two arms at a time. By standing up and using one arm at a time, you can increase the muscle activation of the obliques. "

One way is to only slightly touch the box with your glutes when you squat. That is: you never really put much of your weight at all on the box. Used this way, the box can serve as an indicator for you, helping you make sure that you are reaching your desired depth.\nAnother common way to perform the exercise, is to actually sit down and put your weight on the box for a few moments, before you rise up again. Used this way, box squats can spare your joints from the otherwise high forces that are generated when you turn in the bottom of a squat. It can also teach positional awareness and train force generation from the bottom."

Two advantages of the dumbbell squat are that it is easy to learn, and you can drop the weights at any moment if you need to. That can make this exercise suitable for beginners, children och the elderly, for example. A disadvantage compared to the barbell squat is that it is difficult to use very heavy weights in this exercise, which means that you eventually might have difficulties increasing the load.\nIf you are having trouble squatting deep, try letting go of one dumbbell, and hold the other one in both hands in front of you, against your chest. See \ngoblet squat\n for a demonstration."

The exercise mimics the catch position of a clean, and it is therefore a common exercise among Olympic weightlifters.\nBecause the center of gravity is shifted forward compared to a regular squat, many find it easier to get deep in the front squat. However, the mobility demands increase in other joints, such as your ankles (which can be helped by lifting shoes with a raised heel) and in your shoulders and wrists. The latter might be solved by using an alternate grip: either by crossing your lower arms and placing your hands on top of the bar or by pulling lifting straps around the bar and holding onto these."

This variant can, however, be quite technically demanding, and a slightly easier variant is the \npower clean\n, where you only bend your knees slightly when receiving the bar."

Both lifts are also commonly trained separately, and can be done with many variations.\nThe clean and jerk develop your explosive strength and power in almost your entire body."

That can make this exercise suitable for beginners, children och the elderly, for example. A disadvantage compared to the barbell deadlift is that it is difficult to use very heavy weights in this exercise, which means that you eventually might have difficulties increasing the load."

The kettlebell swing is primarily an exercise for your glutes, back, and posterior thighs, and therefore you shouldn\u2019t bend your knees more than just slightly. If you want to train your quads (front of the thigh) with a kettlebell, then goblet squats or front squats are a better alternative.\nIn order to make the exercise heavier, you can of course use a heavier kettlebell, but another alternative is to hold one lighter kettlebell in each hand.\nAnother alternative is one-handed kettlebell swings, where you hold a single kettlebell in only one hand. This will have you fighting to resist the rotational pull of the kettlebell, and thus increasing the training effect of the obliques.\nLastly, the kettlebell swing is an exercise that is also suited for cardio training, for example by training short, intensive intervals."
