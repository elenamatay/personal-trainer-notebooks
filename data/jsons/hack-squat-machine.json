"steps": "\n1. Adjust the machine to the correct height and place your shoulders comfortably against the shoulder pads. \n2. Place your feet on the platform, slightly in front of the base of the sled and about shoulder-width apart, with your toes pointing slightly outwards. \n3. Extend your legs to disengage the sled's safety locks. \n4. Inhale, brace your core, and squat down as deep as you can with good form, maintaining contact between your back and the backrest. \n5. Reverse the movement by pushing through your heels and extend your legs until you're back in the starting position. Exhale on the way up.",
