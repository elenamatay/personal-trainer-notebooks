"form": {
"steps": "\n1. Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor, hip-width apart. Your arms should be at your sides with your palms facing down.\n2. Engage your core and glutes, and push through your heels to lift your hips off the floor. \n3. Drive your hips upward until your body forms a straight line from your shoulders to your knees. \n4. Squeeze your glutes at the top of the movement, and hold for a moment. \n5. Slowly lower your hips back down to the starting position, vertebrae by vertebrae.",
"form": {
"Feet": "Keep your feet flat on the ground, approximately hip-width apart, and ensure your toes are pointing straight ahead.",
"Hips": "Drive your hips upward in a controlled motion, maintaining a neutral spine. Avoid overextending your lower back at the top of the movement.",
"Core": "Engage your core muscles throughout the exercise to stabilize your body and protect your lower back.",
"Shoulders and Upper Back": "Keep your shoulders and upper back flat on the ground throughout the exercise. Avoid shrugging your shoulders.",
"Glutes": "Focus on using your glutes to lift and lower your hips. Squeeze your glutes at the top of the movement for maximum activation."
}
},
"commonMistakes": {
"Arching the lower back": "This can lead to lower back pain. Make sure to engage your core and keep your pelvis tucked to maintain a neutral spine.",
"Pushing through the toes": "Instead of pushing through your heels, which ensures the glutes are properly activated.",
"Not squeezing the glutes": "Focus on contracting your glutes at the top of the movement to maximize muscle activation.",
"Lifting the hips too high": "Overextending your hips can put stress on your lower back. Stop when your body forms a straight line from shoulders to knees."
},
"comments": {
"Glute Activation": "The glute bridge is an excellent exercise for activating and strengthening the glutes, which are essential for hip extension, rotation, and stability.",
"Warm-up or Workout": "It can be used as a warm-up exercise to activate the glutes before compound movements like squats and deadlifts, or it can be incorporated into your workout as a primary or accessory exercise.",
"Progression": "To make the glute bridge more challenging, you can add weight by placing a barbell, plate, or dumbbell across your hips. You can also increase the difficulty by performing single-leg glute bridges or by using resistance bands.",
"Posterior Chain Engagement": "The glute bridge also engages the hamstrings and lower back muscles, contributing to a stronger posterior chain."
},
"alternativesAndVariations": {
"Barbell Glute Bridge": "Performed with a barbell across your hips, allowing for increased resistance and progressive overload.",
"Single-Leg Glute Bridge": "Performed with one leg elevated, increasing the challenge and promoting muscle imbalances.",
"Hip Thrust": "A more advanced variation performed with your upper back elevated on a bench, allowing for a greater range of motion and increased glute activation.",
"Glute Bridge with Band": "Performed with a resistance band placed above your knees, increasing glute activation and promoting hip abduction."
},
"tempo": "2020 (2 seconds lifting, 0 seconds pause at the top, 2 seconds lowering, 0 seconds pause at the bottom)"
