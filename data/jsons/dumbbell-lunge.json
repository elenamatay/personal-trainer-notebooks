"steps": "\n1. Stand tall with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand with a neutral grip (palms facing each other). \n2. Engage your core, and take a big step forward with one leg. \n3. Sink (descend) as deep as possible in a lunge position, without hitting the knee of the back leg in the floor (this is usually until both knees are bent at 90-degree angles). During descent, keep your front heel flat on the ground and your front knee tracking in line with your toes. \n4. Push yourself back with your front leg to return to the starting position.",

"Balance": "The lunge is an exercise that not only strengthens your leg muscles, but it can also be used to train your balance, coordination and control.",
"Progression": "As you get stronger, you can increase the weight of the dumbbells, use a split stance (one leg further forward than shoulder-width apart) or perform walking lunges."

"alternativesAndVariations": {
"Barbell Lunge": "Similar to the dumbbell lunge, but using a barbell for increased weight and stability. The main difference is the equipment used.",
