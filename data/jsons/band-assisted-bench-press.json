      "Steps": "1. Attach the resistance band under the bench, loop it around the barbell, and back under the bench., \n2. Lie on the bench with feet flat, back slightly arched, and shoulder blades retracted., \n3. Grip the barbell at your preferred width., \n4. Unrack the barbell and position it above your chest., \n5. Lower the barbell to your chest, keeping tension in your upper body., \n6. Press the barbell back up to the starting position against the band., \n7. Repeat for reps.",
      "Form": "Core and Posture: When you’ve jumped/climbed up to the starting position, make sure to embrace your core and to have a good posture. Keep your shoulders down and back. If you don’t keep the tension in your core, the movement will be much more unstable and wobbly. \nLegs: By crossing your ankles and having a slight bend in your knees, you’ll help to make the movement even more stable. Movement: Make sure to do the entire movement with full control. Do not rush, and keep your form strict. Your elbows should go backward, not out, and your shoulders should stay down and back. You should adapt the weight to your strength level: If the bar dip is too heavy for you, you can adjust the weight by taking a resistance band and placing it around your wrists. Let the band hang between your arms, forming a U shape. Place your feet or knees on the band, which will help you on the way up. If the exercise is too easy, you can add extra weight by getting a weight belt and attaching weight plates to it.  \nHand position: There are two major points to consider regarding how you grip the bar: 1. Your thumb must be on the opposing side of your other fingers, meaning that you grip around the bar: {grip_with_thumb}. I strongly recommend that you avoid using a thumbless grip (this is having the thumb in the same side than all fingers: {grip_suicide}). Firstly, it is not allowed in powerlifting. More importantly, it is also known as the suicide grip. This is because you can easily slip and drop the bar with a high risk of injury. Don’t use it. 2. The bar should rest in a comfortable place. As you’re lifting heavier and heavier weights, this might become tricky. For most people, the most comfortable and stable position is to hold the bar as close to the base of your palm as possible, i.e. close to or directly above your wrist. This minimizes the leverage the bar works on your wrist and makes it easier to hold. Combining the two points (keeping your thumb around the bar, while still keeping it low in your hand) above might be tricky, and one solution is to slightly rotate your hands inwards so that the barbell rests in a diagonal line in your palm. Don’t keep a completely straight wrist. This puts you at risk of losing balance, tilting your wrist forward, and dropping the barbell. Instead, tilt your wrist back slightly, to better rest the barbell in your hand. \nElbow Position: Where should your elbows be during the lift: close to your body or out to the sides? It depends on your grip width, your anatomy, and also your purpose with bench pressing. Grip width generally determines elbow position, with a wide grip typically leading to your elbows pointing out, and a close grip leading to your elbows being closer to your sides. If you bench press in order to grow your chest muscles, a rather wide elbow position and a wide grip is effective. If you bench press in order to train your triceps, a close grip with your elbows close to your sides is effective. If you want to lift as much weight as possible, something in between (around 45° to your sides) is probably best. You will, however, have to experiment for yourself and see what feels the best and suits your body. \nShoulder Blades: Your shoulders are mobile joints. But when you’re bench pressing, you want to trade some of that mobility for stability. Therefore, you will want to contract the scapulae (pull your shoulder blades down and back before you unrack the bar), and keep them in this position throughout the lift. If you don't know what this means, visualize that you’re putting them in your back pockets, but on the opposing side, i.e. your right shoulder blade into your left back pocket, and vice versa. Note that you will have to “set” your shoulder blades in this manner before you even unrack the bar, because when you’ve got a heavy bar in your hands, it’s too late. Then, your shoulder blades stay in this position until you re-rack the barbell again. That means you will keep your shoulder blades retracted and pulled down even as you’re pressing the bar up, which might require some practice. Pulling your shoulder blades down and back and keeping them in this position during your entire set will protect your shoulder joints and provide you with a solid base, enabling you to lift more. E: CONTINUE WITH FOOT POSITION."

    "tempo": "2110 or 3010: 2 seconds eccentric phase (lowering the weight), 0-1 second at the bottom, 1 second for lifting (concentric phase). Why? The band helps most at the bottom of the lift, so a slightly slower eccentric (2-3 seconds) helps you control the weight and maximize muscle engagement throughout the range of motion. A brief pause at the bottom reinforces good form.",
    "commonMistakes": "1. Not keeping your shoulders down. By letting your shoulders shrug up towards your ears, you’ll make the movement less efficient, increase the stress on the shoulder joint, and could cause discomfort in the neck and shoulder area rather than exercising the targeted muscles. \n2. Half reps. Since the bar dip is quite a heavy exercise, it’s easy to start to cut off depth to be able to do more reps. Don’t do this. Focus instead on maintaining a full range of motion (in line with your mobility). If the movement is too heavy, add a resistance band to reduce some of the weight. \n3. Not maintaining form. Using momentum, swinging the body to complete the movement, arching your lower back, and/or flaring your elbows out to the sides, rather than relying on controlled, targeted muscle activation, is a common mistake while doing bar dips.",
    "comments": "The bench press against bands is a variation of the bench press in which resistance bands increase the tension as you press up. This makes it more challenging to lock out the lift, enhancing strength and power. It’s typically used to improve explosive strength and stability. Make sure to use the safety racks or to have a spotter while performing this exercise.",
    "alternativesAndVariations": "1. Bench Dip (puts more emphasis on your triceps, it's usually a bit easier). \n2. Bench Press: one of the most popular exercise, could be a good substitute if having shoulder pain when performing bar dips. \n3. Close-Grip Push-Up (more emphasis on your triceps)."
