If the bars are too far away from each other, youâ€™ll end up with a weird movement for your shoulders, and it will be hard to maintain a proper form. If they are too close together, it will be hard to reach a good depth. ",

    "comments": "The bar dip is a classic upper-body exercise, and for most people, heavy enough to give a good training effect with the body weight alone as resistance.
