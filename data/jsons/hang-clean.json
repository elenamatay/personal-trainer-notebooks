"hang-clean": {
"form": {
"steps": "\n1. Stand with your feet hip-width apart, with a barbell on the floor in front of you. \n2. Hinge at your hips to grip the barbell with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. \n3. Keeping your back straight and core engaged, lift the barbell off the floor by extending your knees and hips. Once the barbell reaches your thighs, transition into the hang position by slightly bending your knees and pushing your hips back, allowing the barbell to hang just above your knees. This is the starting position. \n4. Explosively extend your hips and knees, pulling the barbell upward. As the barbell reaches chest height, shrug your shoulders powerfully to assist the upward movement. \n5. As the barbell continues to rise, quickly rotate your elbows forward and pull yourself under the bar, dropping into a quarter-squat position with your elbows high and pointing forward. \n6. Catch the barbell on your upper chest and shoulders, with your fingertips lightly touching the bar. \n7. Stand up completely, extending your legs and keeping the barbell stable. \n8. Lower the barbell back to the starting position with control by reversing the movement.",

"commonMistakes": {
"Rounding the Back": "This is a common mistake that can lead to lower back injury. Make sure to keep your back straight throughout the entire movement.",
"Not Exploding Upwards": "The hang clean requires a powerful and explosive upward movement. Don't try to lift the weight slowly or you'll lose momentum.",
"Not Pulling Under the Bar": "You need to quickly pull yourself under the barbell in order to catch it in the correct position. If you don't pull under, you'll likely miss the lift.",
"Catching the Barbell on Your Fingers": "The barbell should be resting on your upper chest and shoulders, not your fingers. If you're catching the barbell on your fingers, you're not getting under the bar properly."
