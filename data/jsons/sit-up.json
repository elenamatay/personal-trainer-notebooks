"Muscle groups used": "The sit-up is a bodyweight exercise that primarily targets the abdominal muscles, specifically the rectus abdominis. It also engages the obliques and hip flexors to a lesser extent.",
"Progression": "You can increase the difficulty of the sit-up by holding a weight against your chest or performing weighted sit-ups on a decline bench.",
