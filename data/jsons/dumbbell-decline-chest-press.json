"steps": "\n1. Adjust a weight bench to a decline angle, typically between 15-30 degrees. \n2. Lie down on the bench with your feet flat on the floor or secured under the foot pads. \n3. Hold a dumbbell in each hand, with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. \n4. Lower the dumbbells slowly towards your chest, keeping your elbows slightly bent and tucked in at a 45-degree angle. \n5. Once the dumbbells reach chest level, pause for a moment. \n6. Press the dumbbells back up to the starting position, extending your arms fully without locking your elbows. ",
"form": {
"Grip": "Overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.",
"Elbows": "Keep your elbows slightly bent and tucked in at a 45-degree angle.",
"Back": "Maintain a slight arch in your back throughout the exercise.",

"commonMistakes": {
"Lowering dumbbells too quickly": "Lowering the dumbbells too quickly can put excessive stress on your shoulder joints.",
"Bouncing the dumbbells off your chest": "This can lead to injury and reduces muscle activation.",
"Flaring elbows": "Flaring your elbows outwards can strain your shoulder joints. Keep them slightly tucked in.",
"Lifting your hips": "Keep your hips down on the bench throughout the exercise. Lifting them indicates improper form and reduces effectiveness.",
"Holding your breath": "Remember to breathe throughout the exercise. Inhale as you lower the dumbbells and exhale as you press them up."
},
"comments": {
"Muscle activation": "The decline dumbbell chest press primarily targets the lower chest muscles, more than the flat or incline variations. It also engages the anterior deltoids and triceps.",
"Range of motion": "Using dumbbells allows for a greater range of motion compared to using a barbell, potentially leading to increased muscle activation.",
"Stabilization": "The use of dumbbells requires more stabilization from the shoulder and core muscles, which can be beneficial for overall upper body strength and stability.",
"Progressive overload": "As you get stronger, gradually increase the weight of the dumbbells to continue challenging your muscles."
},
"alternativesAndVariations": {
"Barbell decline chest press": "This variation uses a barbell instead of dumbbells, which can allow for heavier weight but reduces the range of motion.",
"Decline dumbbell flyes": "This exercise focuses more on the pecs and provides a greater stretch at the bottom of the movement.",
"Decline push-ups": "A bodyweight alternative that can be done with your feet elevated on a bench.",
"Cable crossovers (low-to-high)": "This variation targets the lower chest from a different angle, providing a unique stimulus."
