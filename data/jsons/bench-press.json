            "Steps": "1. Lie on the bench, pull your shoulder blades together and down, and slightly arch your back. \n2. Grip the bar slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. \n3. Inhale, hold your breath, and unrack the bar. \n4. Lower the bar with control, until it touches your chest somewhere close to your sternum. \n5. Push the bar up to the starting position while exhaling. \n6. Take another breath while in the top position, and repeat for reps.",
            "Form": {
                "Position on the Bench":"In most bench press federations, the back of your head, your upper back, and your glutes must remain in contact with the bench at all times, and your feet must touch the floor. You should place yourself close enough to the bar so that you can easily unrack it. If you are too close to the foot end of the bench, unracking the bar will be excessively heavy. If you are too close to the head end, you will hit the rack with the bar when you’re lifting. A good rule of thumb is to lie down so that your eyes or nose are directly below the racked bar. This will be close enough for you to unrack it easily, but not close enough to hit the rack while you’re benching. If you’re tall, you can probably slide even closer to the head end without hitting the rack, and if you’re short, you might have to be a little bit closer to the foot end.",
                "Hand position": "There are two major points to consider regarding how you grip the bar: 1. Your thumb must be on the opposing side of your other fingers, meaning that you grip around the bar. 2. The bar should rest in a comfortable place. As you’re lifting heavier and heavier weights, this might become tricky. For most people, the most comfortable and stable position is to hold the bar as close to the base of your palm as possible, i.e. close to or directly above your wrist. This minimizes the leverage the bar works on your wrist and makes it easier to hold. Combining the two points (keeping your thumb around the bar, while still keeping it low in your hand) above might be tricky, and one solution is to slightly rotate your hands inwards so that the barbell rests in a diagonal line in your palm. Don’t keep a completely straight wrist. This puts you at risk of losing balance, tilting your wrist forward, and dropping the barbell. Instead, tilt your wrist back slightly, to better rest the barbell in your hand. \nShoulder Blades: Your shoulders are mobile joints. But when you’re bench pressing, you want to trade some of that mobility for stability. Therefore, you will want to contract the scapulae (pull your shoulder blades down and back before you unrack the bar), and keep them in this position throughout the lift. If you don't know what this means, visualize that you’re putting them in your back pockets, but on the opposing side, i.e. your right shoulder blade into your left back pocket, and vice versa. Note that you will have to “set” your shoulder blades in this manner before you even unrack the bar, because when you’ve got a heavy bar in your hands, it’s too late. Then, your shoulder blades stay in this position until you re-rack the barbell again. That means you will keep your shoulder blades retracted and pulled down even as you’re pressing the bar up, which might require some practice. Pulling your shoulder blades down and back and keeping them in this position during your entire set will protect your shoulder joints and provide you with a solid base, enabling you to lift more. \nFoot position: The goal of your foot position is to keep you stable and support you throughout the lift. You will want to place your feet firmly on the floor and keep them still throughout the lift. Don’t fidget with your feet, as that will rob you of any stability. Don’t move your feet around after you’ve unracked the bar. Plant them, unrack, and then keep your feet still until you’ve racked the bar again. An exception is if you go up on your toes when you’re unracking, but in that case, plant your feet on the floor again as soon as you’re in position. \nLeg Drive (pro): Leg drive simply means that you apply a slight push with your legs. This will contract and tense your leg muscles, which in turn makes your whole body a little harder and more stable. And as the bench press is a lift that thrives on stability, you will likely be able to lift a little more weight because of this. To use leg drive in the bench press, push with your legs like if you tried to slide yourself over the head end of the bench. Meaning, you should apply force horizontally with your feet, away from the foot end of the bench. Note that you should only apply just enough force so that your feet don’t move. Your feet should still be completely still throughout the entire lift. You’re only pushing just enough to stay within the limits of friction, in order to tense your legs and stabilize your body.",
                "Elbow Position: Where should your elbows be during the lift, close to your body or out to the sides?": "It depends on your grip width, your anatomy, and also your purpose with bench pressing. Grip width generally determines elbow position, with a wide grip typically leading to your elbows pointing out, and a close grip leading to your elbows being closer to your sides. If you bench press in order to grow your chest muscles, a rather wide elbow position and a wide grip is effective. If you bench press in order to train your triceps, a close grip with your elbows close to your sides is effective. If you want to lift as much weight as possible, something in between (around 45° to your sides) is probably best. You will, however, have to experiment for yourself and see what feels the best and suits your body",

This will contract and tense your leg muscles, which in turn makes your whole body a little harder and more stable. And as the bench press is a lift that thrives on stability, you will likely be able to lift a little more weight because of this. The leg drive is not a magical way of using force applied with your legs into the floor to lift the bar. That is simply not how mechanics work. If you by “leg drive” mean that you are heaving your entire body upwards by pushing against the floor, then yes: you will have actually used your legs to lift the bar. This is not a recommended technique. To reiterate: the point of the leg drive is to stabilize your legs and torso, and thereby improve performance in the lift. But  How do you use leg drive in the bench press? What you should NOT do is to push your feet down into the floor. This will only lead to you lifting your butt off the bench, which is, once again, not allowed in competition and not a technique I recommend for anyone. What you should do instead, is to push with your legs like if you tried to slide yourself over the head end of the bench. Meaning, you should apply force horizontally with your feet, away from the foot end of the bench. Note that you should only apply just enough force so that your feet don’t move.

            "How Wide Should You Grip the Bar?": "Your correct grip width will depend on your anatomy, and also your goal with the exercise. Typically, people are stronger (can lift more weight) with a wider grip than with a narrower grip. The wider you grip the bar, the greater is the contribution of your chest and front delts. Conversely, the narrower you grip the bar, the greater is the contribution of your triceps. In a wide-grip bench press, your chest and front delts contribute 78% of the force necessary to lift the bar, while your triceps contribute 22%. In a close-grip bench press, the same numbers are 63% vs. 37%. The maximum grip width allowed in powerlifting is 81 cm between your hands. A powerlifting bar has rings marking this distance, and so your maximum grip width is when your index fingers cover these rings.",
            "Pro tip - Foot position": "Place your feet somewhere where you feel comfortable, stable, where you are able to produce some manner of leg drive. If you don’t know where to start, try placing your feet about hip-width apart, with your legs bent at a 90-degree angle or slightly more.",
            "Should You Pause With the Bar on Your Chest, or “Touch and Go”?": "If you don’t train for powerlifting, pausing in the bottom position is optional. It probably doesn’t have any additional benefits for building muscle compared to a controlled reversal. It might, however, help you improve your technique because you slow things down and get more practice in one of the hardest parts of the lift. Similarly, pausing can improve your strength off your chest. Bench pressing without a pause on your chest is called touch and go. You lower the bar down and touch your chest, without neither pausing nor bouncing, and then press the bar up again. Avoid bouncing the bar on your chest. It puts you at risk of injuring your ribs or your sternum, which can put a stop to your training for a long time.",
            "Pro tip:": "Push-ups work the same muscles as the bench press (= your chest, front deltoid, and triceps) in a similar movement, and can therefore be used as an bench press accessory exercise."

            "Feet-Up Bench Press":"Feet-Up Bench Press greatly inhibits the amount of arch you can create with your lower back, and thus forces you into a more flat bench press technique.

            "Incline Bench Press":"Inclining the bench emphasizes your upper chest muscles and anterior deltoids. Typically, a slight decline of about 30° is enough to get this effect. A popular variation of the incline bench press is to trade the barbell for a pair of dumbbells and perform incline dumbbell presses instead. Many people feel that the freedom of motion of the dumbbells enable them to lift in a more comfortable movement path.",
            "Smith Machine Bench Press":"Doing bench press in a Smith Machine has pros and cons. On the pro side is the extra stability, which might enable you to work your muscles a little harder than usual because you don’t have to worry about balance. On the negative side, we have the fact that a normal, free barbell bench press doesn’t move in a vertical bar path (see the section on bar path for more info). The smith machine, however, forces you to work in a straight line, which an experienced bench presser might perceive as uncomfortable."
