"one-handed-bar-hang": {
"form": {
"steps": "\n1. Grab a bar with one hand, overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width. \n2. Hang from it, allowing your body to fully extend.",
"form": {
"Shoulder": "Start off by hanging with a tensed and active shoulder, keeping it engaged. As you get stronger, you can gradually experiment with hanging with a more relaxed shoulder.",
"Body": "Keep your body straight and avoid swinging. You should feel the stretch in your lats and shoulders."
}
},
"commonMistakes": {
"Swinging": "Swinging the body to make the hang easier. Keep your body still and controlled.",
"Relaxed Shoulder": "Letting the shoulder completely relax, especially when starting, can lead to injury. Start with an active shoulder and gradually relax as you build strength.",
"Death Grip": "Squeezing the bar too hard. While a firm grip is important, excessively squeezing can lead to fatigue. Find a balance between a firm and relaxed grip."
},
"comments": {
"Grip Strength": "Hanging from a bar is a great way to train your grip strength, which is important for various activities, including weightlifting, climbing, and everyday tasks.",
"Shoulder Mobility": "This exercise can improve your shoulder mobility, particularly for holding your arms above your head. This is beneficial for exercises like overhead presses and pull-ups.",
"Progression": "You can progress this exercise by gradually increasing the hang time or by adding weight to a weight belt.",
"Variations": "You can vary the grip (overhand, underhand, neutral) to target different muscle groups."
},
