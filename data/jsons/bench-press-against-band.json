      "Steps": "1. Attach the resistance band under the bench, loop it around the barbell, and back under the bench., \n2. Lie on the bench with feet flat, back slightly arched, and shoulder blades retracted., \n3. Grip the barbell at your preferred width., \n4. Unrack the barbell and position it above your chest., \n5. Lower the barbell to your chest, keeping tension in your upper body., \n6. Press the barbell back up to the starting position against the band., \n7. Repeat for reps.",
      "Form": {
        "Position on the Bench":"In most bench press federations, the back of your head, your upper back, and your glutes must remain in contact with the bench at all times, and your feet must touch the floor. You should place yourself close enough to the bar so that you can easily unrack it. If you are too close to the foot end of the bench, unracking the bar will be excessively heavy. If you are too close to the head end, you will hit the rack with the bar when you’re lifting. A good rule of thumb is to lie down so that your eyes or nose are directly below the racked bar. This will be close enough for you to unrack it easily, but not close enough to hit the rack while you’re benching. If you’re tall, you can probably slide even closer to the head end without hitting the rack, and if you’re short, you might have to be a little bit closer to the foot end.",
        "Hand position": "There are two major points to consider regarding how you grip the bar: 1. Your thumb must be on the opposing side of your other fingers, meaning that you grip around the bar. 2. The bar should rest in a comfortable place. As you’re lifting heavier and heavier weights, this might become tricky. For most people, the most comfortable and stable position is to hold the bar as close to the base of your palm as possible, i.e. close to or directly above your wrist. This minimizes the leverage the bar works on your wrist and makes it easier to hold. Combining the two points (keeping your thumb around the bar, while still keeping it low in your hand) above might be tricky, and one solution is to slightly rotate your hands inwards so that the barbell rests in a diagonal line in your palm. Don’t keep a completely straight wrist. This puts you at risk of losing balance, tilting your wrist forward, and dropping the barbell. Instead, tilt your wrist back slightly, to better rest the barbell in your hand. \nShoulder Blades: Your shoulders are mobile joints. But when you’re bench pressing, you want to trade some of that mobility for stability. Therefore, you will want to contract the scapulae (pull your shoulder blades down and back before you unrack the bar), and keep them in this position throughout the lift. If you don't know what this means, visualize that you’re putting them in your back pockets, but on the opposing side, i.e. your right shoulder blade into your left back pocket, and vice versa. Note that you will have to “set” your shoulder blades in this manner before you even unrack the bar, because when you’ve got a heavy bar in your hands, it’s too late. Then, your shoulder blades stay in this position until you re-rack the barbell again. That means you will keep your shoulder blades retracted and pulled down even as you’re pressing the bar up, which might require some practice. Pulling your shoulder blades down and back and keeping them in this position during your entire set will protect your shoulder joints and provide you with a solid base, enabling you to lift more. \nFoot position: The goal of your foot position is to keep you stable and support you throughout the lift. You will want to place your feet firmly on the floor and keep them still throughout the lift. Don’t fidget with your feet, as that will rob you of any stability. Don’t move your feet around after you’ve unracked the bar. Plant them, unrack, and then keep your feet still until you’ve racked the bar again. An exception is if you go up on your toes when you’re unracking, but in that case, plant your feet on the floor again as soon as you’re in position. \nLeg Drive (pro): Leg drive simply means that you apply a slight push with your legs. This will contract and tense your leg muscles, which in turn makes your whole body a little harder and more stable. And as the bench press is a lift that thrives on stability, you will likely be able to lift a little more weight because of this. To use leg drive in the bench press, push with your legs like if you tried to slide yourself over the head end of the bench. Meaning, you should apply force horizontally with your feet, away from the foot end of the bench. Note that you should only apply just enough force so that your feet don’t move. Your feet should still be completely still throughout the entire lift. You’re only pushing just enough to stay within the limits of friction, in order to tense your legs and stabilize your body.",
        "Elbow Position: Where should your elbows be during the lift, close to your body or out to the sides?": "It depends on your grip width, your anatomy, and also your purpose with bench pressing. Grip width generally determines elbow position, with a wide grip typically leading to your elbows pointing out, and a close grip leading to your elbows being closer to your sides. If you bench press in order to grow your chest muscles, a rather wide elbow position and a wide grip is effective. If you bench press in order to train your triceps, a close grip with your elbows close to your sides is effective. If you want to lift as much weight as possible, something in between (around 45° to your sides) is probably best. You will, however, have to experiment for yourself and see what feels the best and suits your body",
        "Shoulder Blades":"Your shoulders are mobile joints. But when you’re bench pressing, you want to trade some of that mobility for stability. Therefore, you will want to pull your shoulder blades down and back before you unrack the bar, and keep them in this position throughout the lift. Visualize that you’re putting them in your back pockets, but on the opposing side, i.e. your right shoulder blade into your left back pocket, and vice versa.

Pulling your shoulder blades down and back and keeping them in this position during your entire set will protect your shoulder joints and provide you with a solid base, enabling you to lift more.",
        "Careful, especially during lock-out":"Make sure to use the safety racks or to have a spotter while performing this exercise."

    },
    "tempo": "2110 or 3010: 2-3 seconds eccentric phase (lowering the weight), 0-1 second at the bottom, 1 second for lifting (concentric phase). Why? The band helps most at the bottom of the lift, so a slightly slower eccentric (2-3 seconds) helps you control the weight and maximize muscle engagement throughout the range of motion. A brief pause at the bottom reinforces good form.",
    "commonMistakes": {
      "Use a thumbless grip (this is having the thumb in the same side than all fingers)": "This is also known as the suicide grip. This is because you can easily slip and drop the bar with a high risk of injury. Don’t use it.",
      "Round shoulders":"You should not round your shoulders on the way up, but instead, contract the scapulae (right position is with shoulder blades down).",
      "Push your feet down into the floor when using leg drive":"This will only lead to you lifting your butt off the bench, which is, once again, not allowed in competition and not a recommended technique.",
      "Half reps":"By not going through the full range of motion, you’re missing out on the benefits of the exercise. Make sure to lower the barbell all the way down to your chest and press it all the way back up to the starting position. If you cannot do the whole movement, consider switching to standard bench press instead."
    },
    "comments": "The bench press against bands is a variation of the bench press in which resistance bands increase the tension as you press up. This makes it more challenging to lock out the lift, enhancing strength and power. It’s typically used to improve explosive strength and stability. Make sure to use the safety racks or to have a spotter while performing this exercise.",
    "alternativesAndVariations": {
      "Bench press": "The classic bench press is a great alternative to the band-assisted bench press. It’s a compound exercise that targets the chest, shoulders, and triceps. It’s a staple in most strength training programs.",
      "Close-grip bench press": "The close-grip bench press is a variation of the bench press that targets the triceps more than the chest. It’s performed with a narrower grip than the standard bench press.",
      "Incline bench press": "The incline bench press is a variation of the bench press that targets the upper chest and shoulders. It’s performed on an incline bench with the backrest set at an angle.",
      "Dumbbell bench press": "The dumbbell bench press is a variation of the bench press that uses dumbbells instead of a barbell. It’s a great exercise for improving stability and balance.",
      "Push-up": "The push-up is a bodyweight exercise that targets the chest, shoulders, and triceps. It’s a great alternative to the bench press for beginners or for those moments in which you don’t have access to a gym."
