    "commentary": "The air squat is a classic exercise that requires no equipment. For the beginner, this exercise might initiate a strength gain all on its own, and for the more experienced trainee it might serve as a mobility-increasing exercise, warm-up or rehabilitation. You can aid your balance in this exercise by holding out your arms in front of you, or even holding a light weight, like in a \ngoblet squat\n."
