        "form": {
            "steps": "1. Place the bar on your upper back. Inhale and brace your core slightly, and unrack the bar.\n2. Take two steps back, and adjust your foot position.\n3. Squat as deep as possible with good technique.\n4. With control, stop and reverse the movement, extending your hips and legs again.\n5. Exhale on the way up or exchange air in the top position.\n6. Inhale and repeat for reps.", 
            "footPositionAndStanceWidth": "Squatting is possible with stances ranging from narrow to wide. Typically, your knees should track in the same direction as your toes. A narrow stance usually means toes pointing forward, while a wide stance means toes pointing outward. Stance width impacts squatting biomechanics, affecting balance and positioning. A narrow stance with toes forward might require pushing your butt back and leaning your torso forward for balance, distributing work between knee and hip extensors. A wide stance allows for a more upright torso while distributing work evenly, especially beneficial for those with long femurs. ", 
            "shoes": "Choose firm and stable shoes for squatting. Squishy shoes hinder performance and increase the risk of accidents. Flat or raised heels depend on your squatting style. Narrow stance with feet forward requires more ankle dorsiflexion, potentially benefiting from raised-heel weightlifting shoes. If unsure, try squatting with heels on small weight plates to assess the impact.", 
            "barPosition": "Bar position can be high (on top of trapezius or posterior deltoids) or low (on upper back, just above the scapulas). A lower bar position reduces the moment arm on the back and hips, allowing for heavier lifts. It also necessitates a greater forward lean to maintain balance. Conversely, a high bar position allows for a more upright torso. A wide stance is often used with a low bar position to accommodate the forward lean and prevent the abdomen from hindering depth.", 
            "balance": "Maintain your center of mass over your mid-foot throughout the squat. The combined center of gravity of your body and the bar should remain over your mid-foot to prevent falling. Heavier barbells make your body's center of gravity less significant, and vice versa.", 
            "core": "The core muscles, including abdominals, spinal erectors, diaphragm, and pelvic floor, work differently depending on the exercise. In squats, the back extensors (erector spinae and multifidus) are heavily engaged due to the load on the back. While the abs are active, they are not a limiting factor in squats.", 
            "unracking": "1. Grip the bar slightly wider than shoulder-width.\n2. Step close to the bar, touching your sternum.\n3. Position your feet under the bar, slightly narrower than your squatting stance.\n4. Inhale, duck under the bar, and place it on your shoulders.\n5. Exhale, brace your core, lats, and traps, and lift the bar by extending your legs.\n6. Take three steps back to clear the rack and adjust your stance. A narrower stance during unracking reduces side-to-side movement and minimizes the risk of hitting the rack.", 
            "descent": "Descend as quickly as possible while maintaining control. A faster descent conserves energy and utilizes the rebound effect (stretch-shortening cycle). However, prioritize control and balance over speed to avoid injury. If you have a slow descent, incorporate higher rep ranges (around 10 reps) to improve energy conservation and refine technique.", 
            "turningPoint": "The stretch-shortening cycle (muscle contracting more forcefully after being stretched) is crucial in squats. A quick and controlled bounce at the bottom of the squat utilizes this reflex, potentially increasing the weight lifted. However, a faster turn also increases the forces on the lower body, requiring greater skill and potentially increasing the risk of injury. Find a balance between speed and control.", 
            "stickingPoint": "The sticking point, typically above parallel, is where lifters often fail. This is likely due to the stretch reflex wearing off, leaving you reliant on muscle force. One technique to overcome the sticking point is driving the hips forward, shifting work from the quadriceps to the hip extensors. If you clear the sticking point, the lock-out is usually easier.", 
            "reRacking": "1. Ensure the rack height allows you to re-rack without going on your toes.\n2. Squat the bar down, maintaining a strong and controlled position, rather than bending forward like a good morning. This keeps you prepared if you miss the hooks or if the rack is unstable."

            "generalSquatMobility": "Limited hip and ankle mobility can hinder squat performance. Improve mobility by squatting more, experimenting with stance width, using weightlifting shoes, or incorporating mobility exercises.", 
            "backRounding": "Back rounding, or butt wink, can occur due to limited hip mobility, balance issues, or poor motor control. Address mobility restrictions, experiment with stance and bar position, or reduce weight and gradually increase it while maintaining a neutral spine.", 
            "toes": "Going up on your toes at the bottom of the squat indicates a mobility issue. Refer to the tips for general squat mobility.", 
            "kneesCavingIn": "Knees caving in, often seen in new lifters, can increase the risk of injury. Strengthen hip abductors (glutes) by squatting with a band around the knees or having someone push your knees together. Alternatively, lower the weight and focus on maintaining proper knee tracking.", 
            "goodMorningSquat": "Hips rising too fast, resembling a good morning, indicate weaker quadriceps compared to hip extensors. Strengthen quads with exercises like front squats, safety bar squats, zercher squats, leg extensions, leg presses, or Bulgarian split squats. Alternatively, lower squat weight and reps to focus on proper form and gradually increase the load.",

            "hamstrings": "Squats primarily target the quads, hip extensors, and back extensors. Hamstrings are not significantly activated during squats.",

            "tempo": "Descend as quickly as possible while maintaining control to conserve energy and utilize the rebound effect.", 
            "initiation": "Many lifters find it beneficial to initiate the squat by pushing their hips back, emphasizing hip flexion in the initial descent.",
