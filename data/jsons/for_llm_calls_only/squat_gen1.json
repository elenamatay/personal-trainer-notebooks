        "Steps": "1. Place the bar on your upper back. Inhale and brace your core slightly, and unrack the bar. 2. Take two steps back, and adjust your foot position. 3. Squat as deep as possible with good technique. 4. With control, stop and reverse the movement, extending your hips and legs again. 5. Exhale on the way up or exchange air in the top position. 6. Inhale and repeat for reps.", 
        "Form": {
            "Foot Position and Stance Width": "Squatting is possible with anything from a narrow stance to a wide stance. Typically, you want your knees to track in the same direction that your toes are pointing, which means that in a narrow stance your toes are usually pointing more or less forward, and in a wide stance your toes point quite a bit outward. Your stance width has large implications for your squatting biomechanics, as it affects how you will have to balance and position everything else above your feet and legs, namely – your body and the bar. If you stand with a narrow feet placement, with your toes pointed forward and let your knees track forward while squatting, you will generally (but not always) have to compensate by pushing your butt slightly further back and lean your torso slightly more forward to maintain balance. This will probably also be your most efficient lifting technique in this particular stance, where you distribute the work pretty evenly between the knee and hip extensors. The opposite would be a very wide stance. As you are not shifting any weight forward, you don’t need to send your hips back, and you don’t need to lean forward to maintain balance. It is therefore generally possible to squat with a more upright torso when you are using a wide stance, while still distributing the work evently across knee and hip extensors. This is especially true for lifters with long (relative to their body) femurs. By pointing your femurs out to the sides, you are essentially “shortening” them, and don’t need to compensate as much with the rest of your body.", 
            "Shoes: Flat or Raised Heel?": "First things first: any shoe you might choose for squatting should be firm and stable. Squatting in a squishy running shoe will hinder your performance, and will in the worst case scenario set you up for an accident. Secondly: Flat or raised heel? Squatting requires a decent amount of ankle dorsiflexion – meaning, bending your ankle joint as you squat down. A narrow stance, feet forward squatting style usually requires more ankle dorsiflexion than a wide stance, feet outward style. Therefore, if you squat with the latter, you might only need to look for a firm and hard-soled shoe and then you’re set. But if you squat more narrow-stanced with feet forward, odds are that you might benefit from a shoe with a raised heel. These are typically called “weightlifting shoes” or “powerlifting shoes” or something like that, and come in a variety of brand and heel raise. Before you make an expensive purchase, you can try out for yourself if shoes with a raised heel might be something for you. Stand with your heels on small weightplates (about an inch thick) while squatting with an easy load, and see how it feels. I do not recommend that you train like this, however, as it could easily lead to accidents.", 
            "Bar Position: High or Low?": "When squatting, you have the option of placing the bar either high or low on your back, and of course everywhere in between. High bar usually refers to you placing the bar high up on your shoulders, on top of your trapezius or posterior deltoids. Low bar usually refers to you placing the bar low on your shoulders, or even down on your upper back. A common placement is just above the upper ridge of your scapulas, and you will have to lean forward to create a small shelf for the bar to rest on to keep it still. There are no lines drawn in the sand where a bar placement goes from being “high” to “low”, and neither is it necessary. Let’s just agree that a bar can be placed higher or lower on your back. The bar placement will determine primarily two things: 1. The distance from the bar to your hips. With a low bar placement, you are bringing the barbell closer to your hips. That means you are decreasing the moment arm that your back and hip extensors works against. That, in turn, means you will be able to lift more weight with the same hip and back strength. 2. Your torso lean. If you place the bar lower down your back, you will have to lean forward more to keep your centre of gravity over your mid-foot. With a high bar placement, you can keep a more vertical torso. An exaggerated example of this effect is a front squat, where the weight is even further in front of your hips, and your torso even more vertical. 3. Knee / hip weight distribution. When you lean forward, you will have to counterbalance by pushing your hips back. This will redistribute some of the workload from your quadriceps to your hips. To counter the forward lean, and to avoid your abdomen and your thighs coming together and thus limiting your ability to reach depth, it is common to combine a low bar position with a wide stance. A wide stance gets your thighs out of the way for your abdomen, and as for balance, will help you maintain a slightly more vertical torso by “shortening” your femurs in the sagittal (side-view) plane.", 
            "Balance in the Squat": "The human body’s centre of mass – also called centre of gravity – is usually located somewhere around your belly button. As you move around, you are always keeping your centre of mass roughly above the middle of your foot – otherwise you’d lose balance and fall over. The same goes for squatting. As you squat down, you will need to keep your centre of mass roughly above the middle of your foot. You can correct slight deviations back and forth (weight going back on your heels or front on your toes) by using the muscles of your feet and calves, but not much. As you add a bar to the equation, you will have to take the bar’s centre of gravity in consideration as well. Or rather, your body will do that for you automatically, to keep you from falling forward or backward. If you weigh 200 pounds and the bar weighs 200 pounds, your combined centre of gravity will be halfway from your belly button (your centre of gravity) to the bar. This combined centre of gravity (you + the bar) will always be centered roughly above the middle of your foot. You will not need to have a trainer check this from the side, nor video yourself – if you’re not keeping the combined centre of gravity over the middle of your foot, you will fall over. The heavier the barbell, the less significant your own body’s centre of gravity will be in terms of balance. The lighter the barbell, the less significant it’s centre of gravity will be in terms of balance.", 
            "The Core Muscles and the Squat": "There are many misconceptions regarding the core and the squat. Let’s clear them up in this section, with the help of scientific studies and biomechanical reasoning. The core musculature is made up of at least a dozen different muscles, both superficial (like your abs and spinal erectors) and deep (like your diaphragm and pelvic floor). The core muscles also surround your spine on all sides: the four abdominals (rectus abdominis, transversus abdominis, and the internal and external obliques) on the front and sides, and the large muscle group erector spinae on the back, are some of the larger ones. Depending on the challenge, different parts of your core will have to work. Are you loading your core from the front? Like when standing in a plank, a push-up position, or pushing a car in front of you. Then your abdominals will have to work hard, especially your rectus abdominus and the anterior (forward-most) parts of your inner and outer obliques. Are you loading your core from the side? Like when you are standing in a side plank, or carrying something heavy in one hand. Then your inner and outer obliques will have to work hard to keep you straight. Are you loading your core from the back? Like when you place a bar over your shoulders and do a good morning – or a squat. Then the muscles on the back of your core will have to work hard, meaning your erector spinae and multifidus (= your back extensors). The posterior (back-most) parts of your obliques will also aid a little, but not much. Overall, your abs are not very active (nor do they need to be) when squatting. That is not to say that your abs aren’t working at all in a squat, but they are very unlikely to be a limiting factor for performance or technique.", 
            "Unracking the Bar": "The lift begins by unracking the bar, and doing this right can improve your performance significantly. The overall goal of the unracking process is to get to the point where you are ready for the descent, while wasting a minimum of energy, and maintaining a strong and stable posture. The bar should be placed at a height where you can comfortably unrack and re-rack it – without wasting unnecessary energy on “squatting up” a bar that is racked too low, nor having to go up on your toes to re-rack a bar that has slid down your back an inch during your heavy squat. A good rule of thumb is to set the rack height so that the bar is resting at the level of your sternum – maybe an inch higher for high bar squatters, and an inch lower for low bar squatters. When the bar is at the correct height, it is time to unrack it. 1. Grip the bar with your hands at your desired grip width. If you don’t yet have one, a good place to start is with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width. 2. Step up close to the bar so that it touches your sternum. 3. Place your feet under the bar, slightly narrower than your final stance is going to be (more on this below). 4. Take a breath, duck under the bar, and place it over the back off your shoulders. 5. Exhale and take another breath. Brace your core, lats and traps. Lift the bar out off the rack by extending your legs. 6. Take one step back with one foot, one step back with the other one, and then use a third step to correct your stance into an even position. Don’t go for a walk with the bar – three steps should be enough to get you out of the way for the rack, while still not expending much energy. Regarding stance width while unracking: If you assume a wide stance when you unrack the bar, you will wiggle more side-to-side as you step back from the rack. This increases the risk that you will bump the weights into the rack on the way out, which can be distracting and put you out of position. Counter this by taking a narrower stance when you unrack, and widen the stance during your three steps back.", 
            "The Descent": "By now you have reached the point where you’re standing at some distance from the rack, with your right stance and the bar on your back. Time to squat! With what we’ve already covered regarding your stance, bar position and squat depth, much regarding your descent is already reined in: You will need to squat down with what you’ve got, to the depth that you need to reach. For the powerlifter, this will be just below parallel. Two things remain to discuss however, of which the first would be the tempo. How fast should you descend in the squat? The answer probably is: As fast as you can while still maintaining control. Why? Two primary reasons: 1. Energy conserving. A slow eccentric costs more energy than a quick one. 2. Rebound effect. The more you are capable of using your tendons and muscles elasticity for a rubber-band effect, the more help you will get out from the bottom. Now, no amount of rebound effect or energy conservation makes a difference if you injure yourself or miss the lift due to balance or some other technical error. Hence why we say “As fast as you can while still maintaining control.”. The right descent speed for you might not be the same as for me, but in general, if your descent takes ages you are wasting energy and losing your rebound effect at the bottom. If you find that you descend very slowly and want to increase your speed, one way to address that is to train a little more in higher rep-ranges, like several sets around 10 reps or so. The high number of repetitions will subconsciously teach you to conserve your energy while you are repping, and thus might make you chip away at some of your technical unneccessarities, like a too-slow descent. Rotate this high-rep work with regular heavier training every now and then, and try to keep the speed in your heavier sets. It will not happen overnight, but can lead to big changes if you practice it during a regular training block of a month or two. Now, if you descend slowly and it works just fine for you – keep doing it, by all means! This is a highly individual technicality, and you must find what works for you. If you however feel that you might gain a little on the ascent if you could speed up your descent just a little bit, then it might be worth giving it some attention.", 
            "The Turning Point": "We have already covered how deep you should squat. This section covers what happens when you reach that point. You might already have heard about the phenomenon called the stretch-shortening cycle. It is the name for the fact that a muscle can contract more forcefully if it has first been stretched. It is the reason for why you can jump higher if you squat down slightly and then immediately reverse the movement and jump, compared to if you would squat down, wait three seconds, and then jump. It is the reason for why you can bench more touch-and-go-style than with a pause. I have referred to this as the rubber-band effect earlier in this article, because it’s main mechanism is likely that energy has been stored in the muscle and tendonds elastic tissue, which then acts like a spring. As a rough estimate, I’d say that most people can squat about 10 % more if they reverse the movement instantly compared to a several second long pause squat. Utilizing this stretch reflex effectively can thus bring rich dividends in terms of added weight. The counter-part is, just like with the descent: how fast can you change the movement (how aggressively can you “bounce”) while still keeping control and avoiding injury? The forces placed on your lower body is twice as high if you decelerate the descending weight, turn the movement, and accelerate again in 0.5 instead of 1 second. This means that your tissues and technical integrity will have to withstand twice the force compared to the slower turn. Greater skill will be required to execute all the right muscle actions and retaining balance in a quicker turning. It might increase your risk of making a technical mistake. So, while a quick “bounce” might benefit your performance, it also bears its own risks. With the turn in the squat, just as with many things, you will have to find your own goldilocks-squat zone of “just right”.", 
            "The Sticking Point and Lock-Out": "The sticking point in the squat is typically considered to be somewhere above parallel. From a personal standpoint, this is in line with my experience as a powerlifter, having both competed at and watched numerous competitions: If the weight is way too heavy for the lifter, he or she doesn’t even get out of the hole. But when the weight is just barely too heavy, they seem to fail somewhere above parallel. When the thigh angle relative to the floor is 33°, you will (depending on your squat style) have squatted down to about a 70–80° knee flexion. That is, somewhere between a quarter and a half squat. But why does the sticking point occur here? Pretty much everyone is stronger at quarter or half squats than deep squats, it doesn’t make any sense that you would get stuck there. Also, wouldn’t the demands of the knee and hip extensors peak when your thigh is parallel to the ground, as that would be the point when your joints are the furthest from the bar, and thus the moment arm would be at their longest? What could be the explanation? My best guess: the bounce. Due to the stretch-shortening cycle mentioned earlier, you get some help from your muscles’ and tendons’ elasticity, and this powers you through much of the demanding range of motion that is around the bottom and the parallel thigh position. But when the rubber band effect wears off, you are left to rely on your own muscle force, while still being pretty close to a very demanding position. Logically, this would mean that the sticking point of a pause squat (where you have eliminated the stretch reflex) is different from that of a normal squat. Intuitively, I have the gut feeling that is the case: in a pause squat that is just barely too heavy, you’d get stuck lower than a 33° degree thigh angle. Perhaps around parallel, or even just below it? However, besides just making your knee and hip extensors stronger as well as trying to utilize the stretch-shortening cycle, there isn’t too much you can do about the sticking point. Except maybe one thing. There is a technique that some lifters use, and that Greg Nuckols have written about, which is to drive the hips under the bar when you reach or approach the sticking point. The rationale is that the demands of the knee extensors have decreased at that point, and by shifting your hips forward you might “lend” some work from the quadriceps to the hip extensors via this shift in moment arms. I haven’t personally tried this technique, but I’ve seen good squatters utilize it often and it might be worth giving it a shot. If you clear the sticking point, the final lock-out will generally be a breeze.", 
            "Re-Racking the Bar": "Putting the bar back isn’t very complicated, but there’s a few details I want to mention. Correct rack height. We went over this in the section on unracking the bar, but it bears repeating: set the rack so that you won’t have to go up on your toes when you’re putting back the bar. Squat it down, don’t good morning it. When you’ve walked into the racks and are about to set the bar down in the hooks, make sure you squat it down rather than just bend forward like a good morning. The reason for this being that you will remain in a stronger position if something should go awry. You could miss the hooks (happened to me) or if you are using a light rack it might even fall over. Keep control over the bar and remain in a strong position until you’re home free."

    }, 
    "tempo": "30X0: 3 seconds eccentric phase (going down), 0 seconds pause at the bottom, X seconds concentric phase (going up), 0 seconds pause at the top. Why? The 3-second eccentric phase emphasizes muscle control and maximizes time under tension, which is beneficial for muscle growth. The explosive concentric phase (X seconds, could be 1 or less) develops power and strength. The lack of pauses at the bottom and top maintains constant tension on the muscles and promotes a smooth, fluid movement.", 
    "commonMistakes": {
        "General Squat Mobility": "There are two common problem areas where people lack the mobility to be able to perform the squat in a safe and efficient manner. They are: the hips and the ankles. If you lack mobility, try to squat more, experiment with stance, get lifting shoes with raised heels, or try to increase your joint mobility directly.", 
        "Back Rounding / Butt wink": "“Butt wink” is when your back rounds (e.g. your spine flexes) in the bottom of a squat. It is usually the symptom of one of three things: 1. Lack of mobility. Your hip joints simply reach their maximum point of flexion, and to keep getting lower, your body has to round your back. Se the section above for tips on increasing your squat mobility. 2. Balance. With the stance, bar placement, bar weight, and your own body’s weight distribution, you might need to tuck your butt in to retain balance and not fall back. In this case there are two solutions: 1) See if this is only a problem at light weights (relative to your body weight). Then, as you progress from the warm-up, the problem may disappear. 2) Experiment with other stances and bar positions and see if you can find a squat style that enables you to squat without a butt wink. 3. Motor control. You might have the requisite mobility and stance to squat without butt wink, but you lack the motor control to keep your spine erect and stable. In this scenario: take off so much weight that you have total control of your spine, and can squat without butt wink. Then slowly and gradually increase the weight over the following weeks of training, while still retaining a straight spine. Use your phone to video each of your sets, or have a workout partner helping you see when you do it right. Is butt wink dangerous? We don’t really know for sure. If you do it and get lower back pain from it, then you should most likely avoid it. If you don’t get pain from it, you’re probably fine. But still, just like we recommend you to strive for a neutral back in our deadlift guide, we recommend you to strive for a neutral back while squatting, and it might be wise to work on it, to see if you can minimize it with time. Check out the list above, as well as the other tips in this guide, to see if you can find something that helps.", 
        "Goes Up on Toes in the Bottom": "If you find that your heels loose contact with the ground and that you shift your weight up on your toes in the bottom, you are likely having a mobility issue as adressed in the former section on general squat mobility. Your body is simply trying to solve the task of squatting down deep enough without losing balance, and with the current movement strategy solves that by going up on your toes a little bit. Try the tips outlined in the section on general squat mobility.", 
        "Knees Caving in": "Knees caving in somewhere on the way up is a common sight in especially new lifters, and seems more common in those who begin with low levels of strength and muscle mass in and around their legs and hips. It is common among young, adolescent girls that might have had a growth spurt, but whose muscle mass hasn’t yet catched up. Knees caving in might be a potential risk factor for knee injuries, and it is generally recommended to try and keep the knee in more of a straight line between your hips and feet. What is happening is that the muscles that adduct (“move in”) your thigh overpowers or outworks the muscles that abduct (“move out”) your thigh. Your adductors, especially adductor magnus, is a powerful hip extensor in the squat, but as the name implies it also adducts your leg. This movement will have to be countered by your hip abductors, two of which the bigger ones are gluteus maxmimus and medius. These muscles will have to get coordinated with each other, where they cooperate to help you squat effectively and safely. There are two good approaches to make this happen: 1. Squat with a rubber band around your knees, or have someone push your knees together. This will force you to activate your abductors (gluteus medius and maximus) more, and acts as a reminder to push your knees out. It might help engrain this in your nervous system, so that you do it even after you remove the resistance. Try this out during your warm-ups, or even in most of your squat sets for several workouts (maybe even weeks), and see if that does the trick. 2. Lower the weight and train with correct technique. This is the most obvious route: just lower the weight to a level where you can control it, and simply rack up good squat sets where you make sure to keep your knees out. This will also engrain this new technique adjustment, and from here you can gradually start increasing the weights again, without losing your new form.", 
        "Hips Rise Too Fast (“Good Morning Squat”": "When weights are approaching 1RM, or you are getting close to failure, it is very common that the squat turns more and more into a so called “good morning squat”. This is the phenomenon where, after the turn in the bottom, you start to rise up, but your hips rise way faster than your shoulders (or the bar), leading to a very forward-leaning position. What is actually happening, when this occurs? The lift (after the bottom) gets separated into two distinct phases: 1. Your legs are extending, which raises your hip, but without moving the bar much or even at all. 2. Not until the legs are more extended and your torso angle is looking kind of like the beginning of a deadlift, does the bar finally start to move as you extend your hips and raise your torso. What is the biomechanical implication of this? Your legs extend without raising the bar much (or at all). This means that your quadriceps have extended without much or any resistance, which in turn means … Your hip and back extensors have to do all the heavy lifting. If your legs have extended but you are left in a forward leaning stance, that means you will have to lift the weight using the muscles that extend your hips and keep your spine straight, like in a good morning or a deadlift. Essentially, work has been shifted from the knee extensors to the hip and back extensors. There might be several reasons for this, but the most likely one is simply that your quads aren’t strong enough to extend against the weight bearing down on them, so they pass over part of the work to the hip extensors. It is very unlikely that this is due to a weak core or weak glutes, both of which seem to be common (mis-)conceptions. If your core or glutes are weak, it would make sense to pass work away from the core and glutes to your quadriceps, thus leading to a more upright, knee-dominant squat. Which is the complete opposite of a good morning-squat. Is it a problem? Not necessarily. It is rather an indicator of where your strengths and weaknesses are right now. Most people will be limited by their quad strength in the squat, and if you display this kind of lifting style, you are likely no exception. The solution in that case would be to focus training on the quadriceps, without overtraining them and risking injury. Here are three examples of routes you could take to prioritize your quad strength while still practicing the squat: 1. Train squats as usual, but add in extra direct quad work. Like leg extensions, leg presses, or bulgarian split squats. 2. Switch some of your squats to more quad-intensive variations where it is harder to pass over the work to the hips. Like front squats, safety bar squats, or zercher squats. 3. Train squats, but lower the weight and reps to the point where you can complete all reps without your hips shooting up. Counter the volume loss in weight and reps by increasing the number of sets."

        "Don't try to fit a square peg into a round hole.": "If you are a powerlifter, then yes, there are potential advantages to the powerlifting-style squat that might enable you to get up higher numbers. But what if you (like me) cannot squat with a powerlifting style without inevitably hurting yourself? Then you are stuck with what you’ve got, and you better make the best of it. I ran my head into a wall for years, trying to train and compete with a powerlifting style squat, but kept hurting my back with it. In hindsight, I wasted my time with it, and should have been further along in my lifting career if I had simply stuck to the weightlifters style squat that my body seems to prefer. Like fingerprints, our bodies are unique, and everyone won’t get to choose how they can perform the squat in a safe manner. World records have been squatted with both styles. Find a squat style that you can perform safely and consistently, and then start training.", 
        "Tempo of the Descent": "How fast should you descend in the squat? The answer probably is: As fast as you can while still maintaining control. Why? Two primary reasons: 1. Energy conserving. A slow eccentric costs more energy than a quick one. 2. Rebound effect. The more you are capable of using your tendons and muscles elasticity for a rubber-band effect, the more help you will get out from the bottom. Now, no amount of rebound effect or energy conservation makes a difference if you injure yourself or miss the lift due to balance or some other technical error.

        "Which Joints Move First in the Descent?": "Just like the descent, this will be a highly individual technical consideration. But, there do seem to be a majority of lifters that find that their squat feels a lot better when they initiate the movement by pushing their butt back. Or in other words: begin with the hips. Yes, if you were to monitor the knees and hips closely, you’d likely find that they both start flexing simultaneously, but the hips flex more than the knees in the initial part of the descent. To try this out, simply aim to lead with the hips next time you squat.",

    "alternativesAndVariations": {
        "Hypertrophy: Exercises that will strengthen and grow the muscles used in the lift.": "The primary movers in the squat are the knee extensors (quadriceps), hip extensors (glutes, adductors), and back extensors (mostly your lower back), so that is the muscles you should be most concerned about strengthening and growing. The options for hypertrophy exercises are many, and more a matter of personal preference than anything else. We will now share some exercises that you might use to supplement your training for the muscles involved in the squat. If you are not sure, we recommend to pick squats + 1–2 of the exercises below, and do 2–3 sets at 1–2 workouts per week. If you squat with a low volume (relative to your training level), you can increase the volume of supplementary exercises: 1. Deadlift (knee, hip and back extensors), 2. Front squat (knee, hip and back extensors), 3. Bulgarian split squat (knee and hip extensors), 4. Leg press (knee and hip extensors), 5. Belt squat (knee and hip extensors), 6. Leg extension (knee extensors), 7. Hip thrust (hip extensors), 8. Kettlebell swing (hip and back extensors), 9. Good morning (hip and back extensors)", 
        "Technique: Exercises that strengthen the movement, or improve the performance or technique of the lift.": "These are generally more taxing than the hypertrophy exercises listed earlier, and also cut in more into your other squat volume. Working sets of the exercises listed below should probably be traded in for your regular sets of squats if you’re already training at a high volume, rather than piled on top of it. 1. Pause squats. Can be used to improve overall technique, and strength around the position that you pause in. We generally recommend pausing in the bottom position, and for a count of three. Pausing in the bottom position also helps engraining a feeling of what correct depth is. 2. Tempo squats. Slowing things down increases your control and body-awareness, and also gives to more time to correct errors. This can be used as an aid to improve technique. I have personally used this to create more opportunity to correct errors like knees caving in, butt wink, and going up on the toes. You can choose to slow down the tempo on the way down, up, or both. 3. Box squats. Can be used for a variety of purposes, including: Finding correct depth, limiting the movement in case of injury, practicing technique and body awareness in the bottom, and training your strength from the bottom. 4. Front squats. Shifts the workload more to your quadriceps and unloads the hip extensors slightly. Increases the demands of especially upper back strength. It can be used to strengthen quadriceps and upper back, and teach a more upright squatting posture. Can be helpful for “good morning”-squatters."
