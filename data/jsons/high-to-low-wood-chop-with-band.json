"form": {
"steps": "\n1. Fasten an elastic band high up (e.g., on a cable machine or a sturdy anchor point). \n2. Grip the band with both hands, step away from the anchor point, and stand sideways to it with your feet shoulder-width apart. \n3. With almost straight arms, make a sweeping, chopping-like movement diagonally downward, pulling the band across your body towards your opposite hip. \n4. Return to the starting position in a controlled manner, resisting the pull of the band.",
"form": {
"Core": "Engage your core throughout the exercise to stabilize your body and control the movement.",
"Arms": "Keep your arms almost straight but not locked.",
"Shoulders": "Initiate the movement from your core, not just your shoulders.",
"Back": "Maintain a straight back and avoid hunching over during the exercise."
}
},
"commonMistakes": {
"Using only arms": "Using only your arms to pull the band instead of engaging your core.",
"Rotating your hips": "Rotating your hips and torso too much, which reduces the engagement of the obliques.",
"Rushing the movement": "Performing the exercise too quickly, which compromises form and reduces muscle activation."
},
"comments": {
"Muscle activation": "Banded wood chops from high to low are a good exercise for your oblique abdominal muscles, as it combines its rotating and flexing actions on the torso.",
"Variations": "You can also perform this exercise from low to high, starting the movement from a low position and pulling the band diagonally upwards."
},
"alternativesAndVariations": {
"Cable Wood Chop": "Similar to the banded version but uses a cable machine instead of a resistance band.",
"Medicine Ball Wood Chop": "A more dynamic variation that uses a medicine ball instead of a band, adding a throwing and catching element to the exercise.",
"Russian Twist": "A bodyweight exercise that targets the obliques by rotating the torso from side to side while holding a weight or medicine ball.",
"Side Plank Oblique Crunch": "A challenging exercise that combines a side plank with an oblique crunch, targeting both the obliques and the core stabilizers."
},
"tempo": "2011 (2 seconds lowering, 0 seconds pause at the bottom, 1 second lifting, 1 second pause at the top)"
