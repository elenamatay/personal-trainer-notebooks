"steps": "\n1. Stand facing a Smith machine or a stable bar. \n2. Grab the bar using an overhand grip, with your hands about shoulder-width apart. \n3. Walk forward until your body is at a slight angle and your arms are fully extended, but keeping your elbows slightly bent, not locked. Your body should be in a straight line from head to heels, like in a standing plank position, with your core and glutes activated. \n4. Bend the arms, bring your torso forward, and lower your head below the bar, until your forehead almost touches the bar. Do the movement slow and controlled, keeping your elbows tucked in close to your body. \n5. Reverse the movement by straightening your arms, pushing through the palms of your hands, until you reach the starting position. \n6. Repeat for reps.",

"commonMistakes": {
"Flaring Elbows": "Letting your elbows flare out to the sides, which can put stress on your shoulder joints and reduce triceps activation.",
"Not Controlling the Movement": "Lowering or raising the body too quickly, which can increase the risk of injury and reduce muscle engagement.",
"Arching Your Back": "Not maintaining a straight line from head to heels, which can put stress on your lower back.",
"Locking Elbows": "Fully extending your elbows at the top of the movement, which can put stress on your elbow joints."
},
"comments": {
"Progression": "If you want to make the movement easier, set the bar higher. If you want to make it harder, set it lower.",
"Alternative": "This is a good alternative for triceps training if you donâ€™t have access to free weights or want to work them with your own body weight.",
"Muscle groups used": "This exercise primarily targets the triceps, but it also engages the core, shoulders, and chest to a lesser extent."
