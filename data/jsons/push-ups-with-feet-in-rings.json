{"push-ups-with-feet-in-rings": {"form": {"steps": "\n1. Adjust the rings so they are about 1-2 feet off the ground. \n2. Assume the starting position, with hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, gripping the rings, and placing your feet in them. \n3. Engage your core to form a straight line from head to feet. \n4. Lower yourself as deep as you can, while inhaling, by bending your elbows and keeping them slightly tucked in. \n5. Reverse the motion, and push yourself up to straight arms again while exhaling. \n6. Repeat for reps.", "form": {"Bodyline": "Try to form a straight line from head to feet throughout the entire movement. Don't let your hips sag or your back arch.", "Elbow Positioning": "Keep your elbows slightly tucked in towards your body, not flared out to the sides.", "Core Engagement": "Maintain a tight core throughout the exercise to stabilize your body and prevent swinging.", "Range of Motion": "Lower yourself down until your chest grazes the floor, or as low as your mobility allows, and push back up until your arms are fully extended."}}, "commonMistakes": {"Lack of Core Engagement": "Not engaging the core, leading to a sagging midsection and potential strain on the lower back.", "Elbow Flare": "Allowing the elbows to flare out to the sides, which can put stress on the shoulder joints.", "Incomplete Range of Motion": "Not lowering the body far enough down or not pushing all the way back up, reducing muscle activation.", "Swinging": "Using momentum to complete the movement instead of controlling the descent and ascent."}, "comments": {"Muscle Activation": "This exercise primarily targets the chest, triceps, and front deltoids. It also engages the core, shoulders, and back muscles for stabilization.", "Progression": "To increase the difficulty, try performing the exercise with lower rings. To decrease the difficulty, elevate your hands by placing them on a surface like a box or bench.", "Bodyweight Challenge": "Push-ups, in general, are a great way to build upper body strength using just your body weight. This variation adds an extra challenge to the core and stability.", "Equipment": "Gymnastic rings are inexpensive and versatile, making them a great addition to any home gym."}, "alternativesAndVariations": {"Ring Push-Ups": "A more advanced variation where your hands are in the rings instead of your feet. This requires greater stability and strength.", "Decline Push-Ups": "Elevate your feet on a bench or box to increase the difficulty and target the upper chest muscles more.", "Incline Push-Ups": "Place your hands on an elevated surface to decrease the difficulty and target the lower chest muscles more.", "Standard Push-Ups": "A classic bodyweight exercise that works the same muscle groups but without the added instability of the rings."}, "tempo": "3010 (3 seconds lowering, 0 seconds pause at the bottom, 1 second lifting, 0 seconds pause at the top)"}}
