    "        - Also don't be afraid of giving lower (even really low) scores when needed.\n",
    "        As part of each score, also suggest all aspects that the user could improve on for each category.\n",
    "        Finally, give pro tips and and (when applicable) improvements suggestions with all the reference content you have on that exercises.\n",
    "        \n",

    "        \n",
    "        3.2.1. Detect which reference information can be useful to the user, based on their execution. In an objective while friendly way, let them know things that may be interesting for them.\n",
    "        These pro tips could be related to potential variations they could do on the form, tempo, range of movement depending on their objectives, or any other aspect that may seem interesting.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        3.2.2. (Only if you detect decreases or deviations that the user could having throughout the video, between reps of this same serie - Prioritise this pro tip if so). \n",
    "        You could detect changes in the velocity that they are performing (e.g. if they are slowing down each rep), changes in their range of movement, or in their form.\n",
    "        Objective of this section is trying to spot potential signs of fatigue. While there's research on fatigue's impact on performance, identifying precise visual cues for each individual remains a challenge.\n",
    "        We do know that fatigue can lead to decreased force production, motor control issues, and an increased risk of injury. Visually, this might manifest as:\n",
    "        - Tempo: Slowing down of movement, especially in the concentric (lifting) phase.\n",
    "        - Range of Movement: Decreases in the full range of motion, possibly due to compensatory movements.\n",
    "        - Form Breakdown: Deviation from proper technique, such as arching the back during squats or leaning forward during rows.\n",
    "        There's significant individual variation in how fatigue manifests. Factors like training experience, fitness level, and exercise selection play a role. This makes establishing universal visual cues difficult.\n",
    "        While not foolproof, a potential sign to look out for is with general Observation: Noticeable changes in movement quality, speed, and form compared to earlier repetitions.\n",
    "        Consequences of Fatigue: Pushing through fatigue can increase the risk of injury, decrease performance, and hinder recovery. It's crucial to recognize the signs and adjust accordingly.\n",
    "        When to Stop or Adjust: There's no one-size-fits-all answer, but general guidelines include:\n",
    "        - Form Breakdown: If proper form can't be maintained, stop the set or reduce the weight.\n",
    "        - Pain: Any sharp or unusual pain warrants immediate cessation of the exercise.\n",
    "        - Self-Assessment: Listen to your body. If you feel excessively fatigued, stop or modify the workout.\n",
    "        Alternatives to Continuing:\n",
    "        - Lower the weight: Use a lighter load that allows for proper form and a full range of motion.\n",
    "        - Change exercises: Switch to a variation that targets the same muscle groups but places less stress on fatigued areas.\n",
    "        - Rest: Take a short break to allow for recovery before continuing (e.g. split into more series with less reps).\n",
    "        If you indentify that a user is having any of the fatigue potential manifestations, ask them to do an exercise of self-Reporting:\n",
    "        If the user reports feeling fatigued or struggling to maintain proper form throughout th exercise, let them know when to stop or adjust, and alternatives to continuing.\n",
